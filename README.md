# ROS-Neural-A-Star

### A quick rundown of the project:

An attempt to create the first ROS2 plugin for a data driven machine learning approach to search-based planning.

This plugin will consist of a modified encoder decoder network trained on costmaps generated from indoor robot simulations using ROS2's navigation2 stack.

This project attempts to generate a variant of the Neural A* search based on  "Path Planning using Neural A\* Search", ICML, 2021 [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07476) [[project page]](https://omron-sinicx.github.io/neural-astar/) that is trained and modified to perform path planning on realtime costmaps generated by SLAM Toolbox.

Neural A * reformulates a canonical A* search algorithm to be differentiable and couple it with a convolutional encoder to form an end-to-end trainable neural network planner. Neural A* solves a path planning problem by encoding a problem instance to a guidance map and then performing the differentiable A* search with the guidance map. By learning to match the search results with ground-truth paths provided by experts, Neural A* can produce a path consistent with the ground truth accurately and efficiently.

Omron's extensive experiments confirmed that Neural A* outperformed state-of-the-art data-driven planners in terms of the search optimality and efficiency trade-off. Furthermore, Neural A* successfully predicted realistic human trajectories by directly performing search-based planning on natural image inputs.

### Goals:

A testbench ROS2 plugin which allows for testing of Neural A* in commonly simulated indoor mobile robot environments.

### Roadmap:

- [ ] Setting up a simulation environment - Turtlebot3 with Nav2 on Ubuntu 18.04, ROS2 Humble, SLAM Toolbox
- [ ] Dataset collection with TB3
- [ ] Evaluation on Vanilla Neural A*
- [ ] Model retraining and Encoder-Decoder network optimisation for CostMaps
- [ ] Creating the Neural A* node that runs realtime on subscribed CostMaps
- [ ] Developing the planner plugin to be compatible with Nav2's planner server virtual methods.

Future considerations:

* Improvements along the lines of adding a parameter interface between the planner plugin and the Neural A* node that allows for tuning and configuring the planner.
* Adding new heuristics and inclusion of Ackermann and Omnidirectional dynamics.




# Path Planning using Neural A\* Search (ICML 2021)

This is a repository for the following paper:

Ryo Yonetani*, Tatsunori Taniai*, Mohammadamin Barekatain, Mai Nishimura, Asako Kanezaki, "Path Planning using Neural A\* Search", ICML, 2021 [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07476) [[project page]](https://omron-sinicx.github.io/neural-astar/)

## TL;DR

Neural A\* is a novel data-driven search-based planner that consists of a trainable encoder and a differentiable version of A\* search algorithm called differentiable A* module. Neural A\* learns from demonstrations to improve the trade-off between search optimality and efficiency in path planning and also to enable the planning directly on raw image inputs.

## Overview
- This branch presents a minimal example for training and evaluating Neural A* on shortest path problems.
- For reproducing experiments in our ICML'21 paper, please refer to [icml2021](https://github.com/omron-sinicx/neural-astar/tree/icml2021) branch.
- For creating datasets used in our experiments, please visit [planning datasets](https://github.com/omron-sinicx/planning-datasets) repository.

## Getting started
- The code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS.
- Try Neural A* on Google Colab! [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/omron-sinicx/neural-astar/blob/minimal/example.ipynb)
- See also `docker-compose.yml` and `docker/Dockerfile` to reproduce our environment.

### Data format (c.f. https://github.com/omron-sinicx/neural-astar/issues/1#issuecomment-968063948)

The datafile `mazes_032_moore_c8.npz` was created using our data generation script in a separate repository https://github.com/omron-sinicx/planning-datasets.

In the data, `arr_0` - `arr_3` are 800 training, `arr_4` - `arr_7` are 100 validation, and `arr_8` - `arr_11` are 100 test data, which contain the following information (see also https://github.com/omron-sinicx/planning-datasets/blob/68e182801fd8cbc4c25ccdc1b14b8dd99d9bbc73/generate_spp_instances.py#L50-L61):

- `arr_0`, `arr_4`, `arr_8`: binary input maps
- `arr_1`, `arr_5`, `arr_9`: one-hot goal maps
- `arr_2`, `arr_6`, `arr_10`: optimal directions (among eight directions) to reach the goal
- `arr_3`, `arr_7`, `arr_11`: shortest distances to the goal

For each problem instance, the start location is generated randomly when `__getitem__` is called: https://github.com/omron-sinicx/neural-astar/blob/e6e626c4d159b0e4c58ee6ad33c7e03db33d72f4/neural_astar/utils/data.py#L114
